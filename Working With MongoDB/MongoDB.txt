1. go to mongodb.com and click try free
2. sign in
3. we are entered mongodb cloud version
4. use free services, aws, region India would be better
5. name is cluster is completely fine
6. give username and password (avoid @ in the password)
7. click on create user
8. IP adress should be 0.0.0.0/0 otherwise it cannot connct with your system. 
9. click connect
10. you come to online version of a database
11. click on connect
12. go to drivers
13. set driver to Python and the verson will be 3.6 or later. 
14. copy from install your driver and paste it to your python IDE
15. then copy from 'Add your connection string into your application code' and paste it to your IDE. 
	make sure that you tick 'View full code sample' then copy and paste to IDE.
16. In IDE, change the password to your given password and run.
17.  in IDE code, use db = client.test with the 'connection string application code' for checking the db. after using the code, use the db to test the server running. 


MongoDB is basically doccument based database. 
unlike SQL, here collections are stored in the database. collection are nothing but like a dictionary. 
here the key value pair is called JSON. 

now create a database
db = client['pwskills']

after making a database, go to mongoDB > Database > Browse Collection > but you cannot see the database untill it have some kind of data. 

so we made a data
data = {"name" : "sudh", 
        "class" : "data science masters",
        "time" : "flexible"}

now we need to made a collection

coll_pwskills = db["my_record"] # it is like defining a name in which the collection will be storerd. 


coll_pwskills.insert_one(data) # now i inserted the data into the databse. now it can be seen in mongoDB

the collection or the data is called in the MongoDB is the dictionary which we call as JSON file. 

pwskills is called database. my_record is called collection name. 



data2 = [
{"name" : "Amy", "Address" : "Apple st 652"}, 
{"Name" : "Anna", "Adress" : "Mountain 21"},
{"Name" : "Michael", "Adress" : "Vally 345"},
{"Name" : "Sandy", "Adress" : "Ocean blvd 2"},
{"Name" : "Betty" , "Adress" : "Green Grass 1"},
{"Name" : "Richard", "Adress" : "Sky Street 331"},
{"Name" : "Susan", "Adress" : "One Way 98"},
{"Name" : "Vicky", "Adress" : "Yellow Garden 2"},
{"Name" : "Ben", "Adress" : "Park lane 38"},
{"Name" : "William", "Adress" : "Central Street 98"},
{"Name" : "Chuck", "Adress" : "Main Road 989"},
{"Name" : "Viola", "Adress" : "Sideway 1633"}
]
let's suppose this multiple records are available in my data. how can be able to use this as my database in single go?
